## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

In this challenge I had the opportunity to learn more about input types and form handling.
With <input type="email"> I've been able to validate the input without the need of an apposite
Javascript function. And with the pseudo elements ::before and ::after I managed to display either the
error message and the error icon adding only one class to the form with the aid of Javascript
and no hidden html elements.

### Continued development

I feel like I've only touched the surface of validation and form handling, I'm going to study more about this subject.
